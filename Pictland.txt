While unusual to us, their purpose must have been clear to the Pictish inhabitants of the Scottish lowlands who erected them, as the symbols were widely used and the stones were often erected along what may have been boundary lines even then; a number of stones were found along what are now parish boundaries, boundaries which were likely based on an older system of land ownership.

A description of the stones might be useful here. Pictish symbol stones range from the rough and almost raw standing stones incribed with a symbol or two, perhaps the so-called pictish beast or a double-disc-and-z-rod, to the carefully worked, finished standing slabs, such as the Drosten Stone. 

Part of the confusion stems from conflating the stones and their uses with the meaning of the symbols, and even more from debate as to just how many symbols there are. 

Seriously. It could be as few as thirty and and as many as one-hundred, depending on who's counting. All of them show up in one place or another; the debate is over whether they are all part of the same family of use, whether that be linguistic or otherwise. The bulls at Burghead? They could have been part of the symbol family, or they could have just been localized reprentations of Burghead's economical foundation. The double-disc-and-z-rod? That is most likely a symbol, and may be evidence of linguistic or at least pictographic use, as it is consistently used on bi-or-trilingual stones in the place of 'Drosten' (the modern Tristan), a p-Celtic word meaning thunder also used as a proper name. Same goes with the 'pictish beast,' which may have stood for 'Edern.' The mirror-and-comb may have been a feminine symbol, or it might have been indicative of high status. 

What I'm basically trying to say is that Pictish symbol stones are weird. 

Huh. Looks like you can upload files from the other repos, so long as you've got them cloned to the hard drive. I think I'm going to like this program.

Mwahaha.
