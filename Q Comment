I mostly wanted to see if you could edit JPEGS inside GITHUB. 
Also, now I know, if you create a file IN GITHUB, you can't open it on the hard drive through the show in folder path through GITKRAKEN even after you've pulled it in.
BUT you can open it through Open File. Good to know.
I just remembered that this repo is a fork off of the teacher's repo. Hopefully I'm doing these commits in the right place. I'll ask him later.
